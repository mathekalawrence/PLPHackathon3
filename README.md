**My prefered STG was Health, where I designed a web-based system called MedChain Tracker.
The system is meant to track and streamline global manufacturing, acquistion, and allocation of the right medicine products especially in times of pandemics which tend to raise concerns of counterfeit medicine and vaccines.
Made with Figma and Superbase**

**The system has the following features:
Authentication features**
Complete signup and login functionality with role-based access control
Support for different user roles: admin, manufacturer, distributor, healthcare provider, regulator, and auditor
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support with demo credentials
Protected content based on user roles and permissions
Professional header with user profile, notifications, and role-specific menus
**
Role-Based Access Control:**
Admins and regulators see full system data and administrative functions
Manufacturers can track their own products and batches
Distributors focus on shipment tracking and scanning
Healthcare providers verify medicines before administration
Auditors access compliance reports and system logs

The application now shows different interfaces and data based on the logged-in user's role, with demo credentials provided for easy testing. Users can seamlessly switch between supply chain tracking, QR verification, and analytics based on their permissions.

**Additional info**
• Integrating Supabase for real user authentication and data persistence
• Adding real-time notifications for security alerts
• Implementing advanced audit logging for compliance tracking
